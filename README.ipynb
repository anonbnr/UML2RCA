    "This project defines UML-to-RCA metamodel transformations. It introduces a generic metamodel transformation architecture and specializes it into the UML-to-RCA use-case. It then uses data provided by the Knowmana project to validate both the architecture and the defined transformations. It relies on the RCA metamodel (*as provided by the rca project available at* https://github.com/anonbnr/rca) and the UML2 metamodel (*as provided by the* `org.eclipse.uml2.uml` *package*)."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "**FCA** is a data analysis and classification method used in many domains of computer sciences (*e.g. knowledge representation, knowledge engineering, information retrieval, supervised/unsupervised machine learning, etc.*), based on the mathematical theories of order and lattices. It is mainly used to formally represent the notions of formal contexts and formal concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal contexts\n",
    "A formal context $K$ is a triplet $(O, A, I)$, where $O$ is a **set of objects**, $A$ is a **set of boolean formal attributes**, and $I \\subseteq O \\times A$ is a **binary incidence relation**, such that every couple $(o, a)$ belonging to $I$ indicates that the object $o$ has the attribute $a$.\n",

    "Given a formal context $K = (O, A, I)$, a formal concept $C$ of $K$ is a couple $(E, I)$, where $E \\subseteq O$ is called the **extension** of the concept, and $I \\subseteq A$ is called the **intension** of the concept. More specifically, $C$ represents a maximum set of objects sharing a maximum set of attributes. Moreover, the set of all formal concepts associated to $K$ is denoted by $C_K$.\n",

    "Given a formal context $K = (O, A, I)$, **FCA** defines a partial order relation, denoted by $\\leq_S$, over the set of all the formal concepts associated to it $C_K$. The order is based on the set inclusion of the concepts' extensions and dualistically on the inverse set inclusion of the concepts' intensions. It can also be interpreted as a formal concept specialization/generalization such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a concept is considered **more general** than another concept if it contains more objects in its extension, while sharing a reduced number of attributes.\n",

    "Given a formal context $K = (O, A, I)$, the subsumption relation $\\leq_S$ over $C_K$ organizes the formal concepts in a complete lattice called a **concepts lattice** or **Galois lattice**, denoted by $(C_k, \\leq_S)$. It relies on a simplified attribute/object inheritance between the lattice's concepts.\n",

    "An **object-introducing concept** is a concept having at least one object in its **simplified extension**, whereas an **attribute-introducing concept** is one having at least one object in its **simplified extension**. On the other hand, A **neutral concept** is one that is neither an object-introducing concept nor an attribute-introducing concept.\n",

    "Given that the number of concepts in a concepts lattice for a formal context increases exponentially with an increase in the sizes of the provided input sets of objects and attributes, it could be useful to represent the concepts hierarchy using other hierarchical structures of representation. In particular, such structures are partially ordered sets (or **posets**), designating suborders that exclude neutral concepts from the complete concepts lattice, and that don't necessarily constitute concepts lattices themselves. Examples of such posets include:\n",

    "# RCA (Relational Context Analysis)\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "**RCA** is an extension of **FCA** (**Formal Context Analysis**) for relational datasets. It allows taking relationships between different categories of objects into consideration throughout the analysis, where each object category is represented by a **concept lattice**, and each relationship is represented by a directed binary link between two lattices, source and target. Relationships between lattices are materialized through relational attributes, integrated to source objects and pointing to concepts in the target lattices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying RCA is an iterative process aiming to refine the relationships between concept lattices, by adding relational attributes to objects of source lattices using **scaling operators**, and discovering new concepts at each iteration, until no new concept can be discovered. At the end of the process, a set of interconnected concept lattices is obtained, which can be represented in a hierarchy of ontological concepts that and can be examined and analyzed using some knowledge representation formalism (e.g. description logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "RCA can be very useful in software engineering, knowledge representation, artificial intelligence, etc. Some applications include refactoring UML class and use case diagrams, extracting OO architectures, web service classification, construction and extraction of ontologies, etc.\n",

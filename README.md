# UML2RCA
This project defines UML-to-RCA metamodel transformations. It introduces a generic metamodel transformation architecture and specializes it into the UML-to-RCA use-case. It then uses data provided by the Knowmana project to validate both the architecture and the defined transformations. It relies on the RCA metamodel (*as provided by the rca project available at* https://github.com/anonbnr/rca) and the UML2 metamodel (*as provided by the* `org.eclipse.uml2.uml` *package*).
